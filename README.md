### What is AlgoSigner?

AlgoSigner is an Algorand wallet extension for Chrome that lets users approve and sign transactions that are generated by Algorand applications. By integrating AlgoSigner into your decentralized application, you can request to connect to a visitor’s wallet, send transactions for their signature, and transmit signed transactions to the Algorand TestNet or MainNet — all without needing to handle keys or secrets.
